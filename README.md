# Realtime Emoji Count for Twitter
There can be many different ways to get real time emoji count for Twitter data. However, the [emojitracker](http://emojitracker.com/) by [Matthew Rothenberg](http://mroth.info/) seems very interesting and easy to me. Thanks Roth for making this simple! There is also [emojistats](http://www.emojistats.org/) but this count is based on iOS devices only. So I decided to use emojitracker data for my work.  

How to get emoji counts
 - Go to [emojitracker](http://emojitracker.com/) and save it as a HTML file
 - Pass this file as an input to parse.py
 - Output will be saved into output.csv file
